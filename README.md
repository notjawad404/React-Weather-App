# Weather App using Reactjs and Open Weather API

I created this project using Vite so to run this app, first use the following commands:
1. npm install (To install require npm packages)
2. npm run dev (To run React app)


In this project, I used Open Weather API to fetch weather data for a city. I added necessary error handling such as showing a message if the user does not enter a city or enters an invalid city name.
